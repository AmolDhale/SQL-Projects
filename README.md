# SQL-Projects
In the dynamic and critical domain of healthcare, efficient management of data plays a pivotal role in ensuring the delivery of high-quality patient care. The adoption of robust information systems is crucial for hospitals to streamline their operations, enhance decision-making processes, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. This SQL project aims to address the specific needs of a hospital environment, providing a comprehensive and organized database solution.
In this SQL project I am going to guide you through the most important process which is OPD appointments. Front office of any hospital is responsible to carry out many activities. They have to handle hospital reception where major tasks like handling customer enquiries,  guiding patient relatives during visiting hours, dispatching health reports on the counter, providing OPD appointments or guiding them to OPD department for appointments, Handling EPABX system and providing accurate and related information to the caller and many more.
They are 2 main departments in the Hospital the first one is an OPD (OUT PATIENT DEPARTMENT) and second is IPD (IN PATIENT DEPARTMENT).
This SQL project is focussing more on the outpatient department and a process called OPD appointments.
